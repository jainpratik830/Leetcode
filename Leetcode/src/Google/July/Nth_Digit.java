        // Lets find the number which contains the n'th digit. We know the following about the
        // intervals of power of 10.

        // Num of digits in 1 - 9: 9*10^0  * 1 = 9
        // Num of digits in 10 - 99: 9*10^1 * 2 = 180
        // Num of digits in 100 - 999: 9*10^2 * 3 = 2700
        // Num of digits in 1000 - 9999: 9'^10*^3 * 4 = 36000
        // so on...

        // The first thing we do is find the interval, so we know how many digits the
        // number containing the n'th digit consist of. We do this by subtracting n with
        // the number of digits in the previous intervals and stop if we come under zero: Ex. if n = 234
        // then the interval is 234 - 9 (1. interval) - 180 (2. interval) = 45 (we stop here or else the next
        // interval brings us under zero), so the number falls in the interval with three digits which gives
        // us that our number consist of three digits with one of them the n'th digit.

        int digit = 1; // How many digits does our number with the n'th digit consist of.
        int num_digits_in_interval = 9; // How many digits are there in this current interval

        while (n - num_digits_in_interval > 0) {
            n -= num_digits_in_interval;
            digit += 1;
            num_digits_in_interval = 9 * ((int) Math.pow(10, digit - 1))*digit; // calculate numbers of digits in next interval

            // This test ensures that we break if we overflow
            if (num_digits_in_interval < 0) break;
        }

        // We now know how many digits our number containing the n'th digit consist of (the variable digit).
        // Now lets find that specific number so we can extract the n'th digit from it.

        // We do this by first locating the interval (variable base). With n = 234, the base is 10^(digit - 1) = 10^(3 - 1) = 100.
        int base = ((int) Math.pow(10, digit - 1));

        // What is the number then? Well its just a matter of dividing whats left in the variable n with the
        // number of digits each number in this interval consist of. Taking our exampel with 234. After the while loop n = 45, so
        // our number is (base + (n - 1) / digit = 100 + (45 - 1) / 3) = 114. Why are we extracting -1? Because we count from zero,
        // and if n was 3 then the n'th digit is in the base 100 which itself consist of 3 digits.
        int number =  base + (n - 1) / digit;

        // Lastly we can find the n'th digit. We do this by converting our number to String to make it easy for us to
        // extract the n'th digit. The n'th digit is just then ((n - 1) % digit). Why -1? Again because we count from 0. Finishing
        // our example the n'th number is "114".charAt((45 - 1) % 3) = "114".charAt(2) = '4'
        char digit_in_number = String.valueOf(number).charAt((n - 1) % digit);

        // digit_in_number is a char, we need to convert it to integer, we do this by extracting the char '0'.
        return digit_in_number - '0';
    }
